## Algorithm
Develop and implement a directed graph topological sorting algorithm using a depth-first graph traversal algorithm. 
Show the operation of the algorithm for solving the problem of studying academic disciplines (or topics of a discipline), 
when the knowledge obtained during the study of the previous one is necessary for the study of the next
